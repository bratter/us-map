 * Make a feature render function based on the object key.

 * For these render functions, there are three ways to join data into the feature's GeoJSON:
 * 
 * 1. Pre-merge data into the TopoJSON before passing to the factory function. This is the most
 *    efficient method but can only be done once- the data can;t be changed on subsequent renders.
 * 2. Bind data to wrapping element as an array of Maps for each instance of the featureset.
 *    The premade feature will merge this data into the GeoJSON feature as part of it's join.
 *    This is the recommended method if data will change over the lifetime of the vizualization.
 * 3. Post-select the paths, then join on id using `g.selectAll('path').data(data, d => d.id)`.
 *    This is NOT recommended as it replaces that original data and requires care in merging.
 * 
 * @param object The type of feature to make
 * 
 * TODO: Move data join method descriptions into the docs and out of here
